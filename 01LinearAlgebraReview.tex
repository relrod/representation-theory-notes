\section{A Review of Linear and Abstract Algebra}

\subsection{Our goal: What is a representation?}
By the end of this review, we want to have enough pieces in place to understand
the definition of a \textit{representation}.

\begin{defn}
Let $G$ be a group. A \textit{representation} (see 3.1.1 in \cite{steinberg})
of $G$ is a homomorphism $\varphi : G \to GL(V)$ for some finite-dimensional
vector space $V$.
\end{defn}

To understand this definition, we need to understand the following terms:
\textit{group, homomorphism,} (finite-dimensional) \textit{vector space}. We
also need to understand how $GL(V)$ is a group.
